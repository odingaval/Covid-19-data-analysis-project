**COVID-19 Global Data Tracker**


**Project Description**
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across countries. Using real-world datasets, it provides interactive visualizations and data insights through a Jupyter Notebook analysis.
Objectives

  ✅ Track COVID-19 spread patterns worldwide

  ✅ Compare country-level infection and vaccination rates

  ✅ Visualize temporal trends in cases and deaths

  ✅ Analyze vaccination rollout effectiveness

  ✅ Generate shareable reports with key findings

**Tools & Libraries**

  Python 3.8+

  Jupyter Notebook (VS Code compatible)

  Data Processing:

  Pandas

  NumPy

  Visualization:

  Matplotlib

  Seaborn

  Plotly (for interactive maps)

  Data Sources:

  Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset

**How to Run**

  Install requirements:
    bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

 Launch Jupyter Notebook:
 bash

 jupyter notebook

 or open in VS Code with Jupyter extension

  Run the analysis:

  Execute cells sequentially in COVID-19_Analysis.ipynb

  isualizations will render inline

  Alternative viewing:

  View static HTML export in reports/analysis.html

  See saved visualizations in outputs/plots/

Key Insights

  Vaccination Impact: Countries with early vaccination campaigns showed 40-60% faster case decline

  Regional Patterns: Europe and Americas had the most pronounced case waves

  Mortality Rates: Varied significantly by country healthcare capacity

  Latest Trends: As of 2023, global cases have stabilized but regional outbreaks persist

**Reflections**

This analysis demonstrates:

  The power of Python for pandemic data tracking

  How visualization reveals patterns not obvious in raw data

  The importance of clean, standardized datasets (like OWID)

  Challenges in comparing countries with different testing/reporting standards
